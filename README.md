## Personal Motivation
In the summer of 2024, Erika and I particpiated in Project RAISE as research assistant interns employed through CSUF's Auxiliary Services Corperation under the direction of Dr. Bein. Throughout our 8-week internship, we had mutliple setbacks attempting to implement pairs trading. Unfortunatly, we determined through multiple test that our stocks were not cointergrated nor correlated. Although our internship ended and no longer work with Dr. Bien, Erika and I stayed in touch and vowed to finish our Pairs Trading Project. This project serves as a reminder that set backs do *not* have to define you. We hope you enjoy our ongoing Pairs Trading Project.
